                                Treatment with OROXAT should be initiated by a
                                physician experienced in the management of
                                anaemia. All other causes of anaemia should be
                                evaluated prior to initiating therapy with
                                OROXAT and when deciding to increase the dose.

                            <p>
                                In addition to the presence of symptoms of
                                anaemia, other clinical criteria should be
                                considered in the evaluation of the individual
                                patient&apos;s clinical course and condition.

                                    Adequate iron stores should be ensured prior

                                    and maintain target Hb levels of 10 to 12
                                    g/dL

                                    meaningful increase in Hb levels is not
