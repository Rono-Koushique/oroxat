# Oroxat

A website built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that provides information about a medicine called "Oroxat". Oroxat is the first HIF-PH inhibitor to have gained approval for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD. It mimics the body's physiological response to hypoxia at high altitude by increasing production of erythropoietin and improving iron availability.
